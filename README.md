CryptoMancers
A Comprehensive Toolkit for Cryptographic Algorithm Detection and Analysis

Overview
CryptoMancers is an open-source framework designed to classify and analyze encryption algorithms based on ciphertext and associated cryptographic parameters. The project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and speed of cryptographic analysis.

Key Features
Algorithm Classification: Detects various encryption algorithms from ciphertext or combined data fields (e.g., keys, plaintext).
Statistical Analysis: Extracts features like entropy, skewness, and kurtosis for enhanced decision-making.
ML Integration: Implements robust models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Extensibility: Provides modular architecture for easy integration with custom datasets and new encryption schemes.
Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently with optimized preprocessing pipelines.
